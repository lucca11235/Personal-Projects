# Feyman's Lost Lecture

This Desmos project was based on this [video](https://youtu.be/xdIjYBtnvZU) by Minute Physics and 3B1B. The basic ideia is to connect many lines
from a point inside a circle to it's perimeter than rotate each line 90 degrees.

Here is the [link](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/znbbahtht0) to my Desmos project.
