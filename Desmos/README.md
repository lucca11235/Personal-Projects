# What is all this?

If you don't know, desmos is the epitome of a how graphical calulators have evolved. Alongside the evolution of the internet, technology, etc..., it was only a matter of time for awesome calculators to start existing, and this is what Desmos is....awesome. 

Desmos's number of functionalities allow for incredible cerations and make it seem like a programming language of it's own. You can create all types of functions, variables that change in the way you want, actions that allow some interaction with the viewer and change variables according to conditions and much more.

So, as a lover of Desmos, sometimes I create projects which I think are worth charing, so here they are.
