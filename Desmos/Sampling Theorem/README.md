# Sampling Theorem

The Sampling Theorem is a fundamental concept in signal processing that states that a signal can be perfectly reconstructed from its samples if the sampling frequency is greater than twice the highest frequency present in the signal. This means that if a signal contains frequencies up to f_max, it can be reconstructed from its samples if it is sampled at a frequency of at least 2*f_max.

I chose to create a visualization of the Sampling Theorem using Desmos because it is a powerful and user-friendly tool that allows me to easily demonstrate the concept and its implications. Additionally, Desmos allows the user to interact with the visualization, which enables a deeper understanding of the Sampling Theorem and how it works. The visualization also helped me to understand the concept better by visualizing the results.
